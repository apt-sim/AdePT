# AdePT

Accelerated demonstrator of electromagnetic Particle Transport

## Build Requirements

The following packages are a required to build and run:

- CMake >= 3.18
- C/C++ Compiler with C++14 support
- CUDA Toolkit (tested 10.1, min version TBD)

To configure, simply run:

```console
$ cmake -S. -B./adept-build <otherargs>
```
As <otherargs> one needs to provide the paths to the dependence librarties VecCore and VecGeom:
```console
   -DVecCore_DIR=<path_to_veccore_installation>/share/VecCore/cmake \
   -DVecGeom_DIR=<path_to_vecgeom_installation>/lib/cmake/VecGeom \
   [-DVc_DIR=<path_to_vc_installation/lib/cmake/Vc] #only in case VecGeom was compiled using Vc backend
   [-DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=<alpakaInstallDir>] #only in case you want to build FisherPrice_Alpaka. <alpakaInstallDir> should point at the folder in which "include/alpaka/" is found.
```

To build, run:

```console
$ cmake --build ./adept-build
```
