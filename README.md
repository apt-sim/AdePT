# AdePT

Accelerated demonstrator of electromagnetic Particle Transport

## Build Requirements

The following packages are a required to build and run:

- CMake >= 3.25.2
- C/C++ Compiler with C++20 support
- CUDA Toolkit (> 12 recommended, tested 10.1, min version TBD)
- [Geant4](https://gitlab.cern.ch/geant4/geant4) > 11.0
- VecCore [library](https://github.com/root-project/veccore) 0.8.2
- VecGeom [library](https://gitlab.cern.ch/VecGeom/VecGeom) >=  2.0.0-rc.4 
- G4HepEm [library](https://github.com/mnovak42/g4hepem) >= tag 20250610
- optional: HepMC3 [library](https://gitlab.cern.ch/hepmc/HepMC3)

### Setting up the environment and installing the dependencies

#### 1. From CVMFS (recommended for users)

A suitable environment may be set up either from CVMFS (requires the sft.cern.ch and projects.cern.ch repos
to be available on the local system):
```console
$ source /cvmfs/sft.cern.ch/lcg/views/devAdePT/latest/x86_64-el9-gcc13-opt/setup.sh
```

#### 2. Via Spack (outdated, currently not recommended)

The dependencies may be installed via spack supplied [spack](https://spack.io) environment file:
Note: the spack environment has not been tested for a while and might be outdated
```console
$ spack env create adept-spack ./scripts/spack.yaml
$ spack -e adept-spack concretize -f
$ spack -e adept-spack install
...
$ spack env activate -p adept-spack
```

Note that the above assumes your spack configuration defaults to use a suitable C++ compiler and has
`cuda_arch` set appropriately for the hardware you will be running on.

#### 3. Manually (recommended for developers)

You can also build the packages manually as follows. To configure and build VecCore, simply run:
```console
$ cmake -S. -B./veccore-build -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX="<path_to_veccore_installation>"
$ cmake --build ./veccore-build --target install
```

Add your CUDA installation to the PATH and LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variables, as in:
```console
$ export PATH=${PATH}:/usr/local/cuda/bin
$ export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}:/usr/local/cuda/lib64
```

Find the CUDA architecture for the target GPU. The GPU can be found via `nvidia-smi`. Then, the list of compute capabilities is available on the [nvidia-website](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-gpus). 
Then, the required `cuda_architecture` is the compute capability without the `.` for the version, i.e., compute capability 8.9 corresponds to `<cuda_architecture> = 89`.

To configure and build VecGeom, use the configuration options below, using as <cuda_architecture> the value from the step above:
```console
$ cmake -S. -B./vecgeom-build \
  -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX="<path_to_vecgeom_installation>" \
  -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH="<path_to_veccore_installation>" \
  -DVECGEOM_ENABLE_CUDA=ON \
  -DVECGEOM_GDML=ON \
  -DBACKEND=Scalar \
  -DCMAKE_CUDA_ARCHITECTURES=<cuda_architecture> \
  -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
$ cmake --build ./vecgeom-build --target install -- -j 6 ### build using 6 threads and install
```
For faster performance with with the solid model, the option `-DVECGEOM_NAV=index` can be used over the default of `-DVECGEOM_NAV=tuple`.


To configure and build Geant4, there are many options available, see the [documentation](https://geant4-userdoc.web.cern.ch/UsersGuides/InstallationGuide/html/installguide.html#geant4-build-options). For AdePT it is important that VecGeom is switched off via ` -DGEANT4_USE_USOLIDS=OFF` (which it is by default), to avoid conflicting the GPU VecGeom build needed for AdePT. Furthermore GDML is required. For example, the following settings work:

```console
cmake -S. -B./geant4-build \
 -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX="<path_to_geant4_installation>" \
 -DGEANT4_USE_SYSTEM_EXPAT=OFF \
 -DGEANT4_USE_GDML=ON \
 -DGEANT4_INSTALL_DATA=ON \
 -DGEANT4_USE_USOLIDS=OFF
cmake --build ./geant4-build --target install -- -j 6
```

To configure and build G4HepEm, use the configuration options below:
```console
$ cmake -S. -B./g4hepem-build \
  -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX="<path_to_g4hepem_installation>" \
  -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH="<path_to_geant4_installation>" \
  -DG4HepEm_EARLY_TRACKING_EXIT=ON \
  -DG4HepEm_CUDA_BUILD=ON
$ cmake --build ./g4hepem-build --target install -- -j 6 ### build using 6 threads and install
```

HepMC3 is optional, but strongly recommended to be able to use the HepMC3 gun in AdePT for realistic events:
```console
cmake -S. -B./hepmc3-build \
  -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<path_to_hepmc3_installation>
  -DHEPMC3_ENABLE_ROOTIO=OFF \
  -DHEPMC3_ENABLE_PYTHON=OFF \
cmake --build ./hepmc3-build --target install -- -j 6 ### build using 6 threads and install
```

### Building AdePT

To configure AdePT, simply run:

```console
$ cmake -S. -B./adept-build \
   -DCMAKE_CUDA_ARCHITECTURES=<cuda_architecture> \
   -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release \
   <otherargs>
```
where `<otherargs>` are additional options from the Build Options below to configure the build.
If one did not rely on an environment setup via CVMFS or Spack, one also must provide in `<otherargs>` the paths to the dependence libraries VecCore, VecGeom, G4HepEm, and optionally HepMC3
```console
   -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH="<path_to_geant4_installation>;<path_to_veccore_installation>;<path_to_vecgeom_installation>;<path_to_g4hepem_installation>;<path_to_hepmc3_installation>"
```

#### Build Options
The table below shows the available CMake options for AdePT that may be used to configure the build:

|Option|Default|Description|
|------|:-----:|-----------|
|ASYNC_MODE|OFF|Enable the asynchronous kernel scheduling mode. Recommended and significantly faster than the synchronous mode in many occasions |
|ADEPT_USE_EXT_BFIELD|OFF|Use external B field from file via the covfie library. If ON, the constant field values are ignored and only B fields from file are accepted! |
|USE_SPLIT_KERNELS|OFF| Run split version of the transport kernels. Requires ASYNC_MODE=ON |
|ADEPT_USE_SURF|OFF| Enable surface model navigation on GPU (still in development, unstable for geometries with overlaps) |
|ADEPT_MIXED_PRECISION|OFF|Use B-field integration and surface model in mixed precision|
|DEBUG_SINGLE_THREAD|OFF| Run transport kernels in single thread mode |
|ADEPT_DEBUG_TRACK|0| Debug tracking level (0=off, >0=on with levels) |

To build, run:

```console
$ cmake --build ./adept-build -- -j6 ### build using 6 threads
```

The provided examples and tests can be run from the build directory. `example1` is a standalone G4 application with AdePT integration.
It can be run with
```console
$ cd adept-build
$ ./BuildProducts/bin/example1 -m <macro_file>   ### for more option, use -h
```
In the build folder, several example `<macro_file>` are generated, such as `example1.mac` or `example1_ttbar.mac`.

## Including AdePT in other CMake projects

In order to include AdePT in a separate project we need to run:

```
find_package(AdePT)
```

Which has the same dependencies as before (VecGeom, VecCore and G4HepEM).

Then, for the targets using AdePT:

```
cuda_rdc_target_include_directories(example_target <SCOPE> 
                                    <TARGET INCLUDE DIRECTORIES>
                                    ${AdePT_INCLUDE_DIRS})

cuda_rdc_target_link_libraries(example_target <SCOPE>
                               <TARGET LINK LIBRARIES>
                               ${AdePT_LIBRARIES})
```
Note that the cuda_rdc is required, which is inherited from VecGeom and needed to avoid multi-cuda dependency issues.
